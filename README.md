Unbeatable Artificial Intelligence Based Tic Tac Toe Game :-

This project features a Tic Tac Toe game with a Human Player, a Random Computer Player, and a Smart Computer Player using the Minimax algorithm to ensure unbeatable gameplay. Enjoy challenging the AI and experiencing strategic moves.
This project is an implementation of an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It features both human and computer players, with the computer player utilizing the minimax algorithm to ensure optimal moves, making it unbeatable.

Features :- 
Human Player: Allows a human to play by entering moves via the console.
Random Computer Player: A simple AI that makes random moves.
Smart Computer Player: An advanced AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring it never loses.

How It Works :-  

The game is built using two main Python files, One contains the game logic, including board setup, move validation, and win condition checks. Other one defines the player classes, including the human player, random computer player, and smart computer player using the minimax algorithm.

The minimax algorithm is used by the SmartComputerPlayer to evaluate all possible moves and choose the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances. This algorithm ensures that the SmartComputerPlayer will always make the best possible move, making it unbeatable.
